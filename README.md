## Introduction
ü§∞ The Pregnancy Due Date Calculator is a Python script that estimates the due date of a pregnancy based on the ovulation date and the average cycle length. It provides an approximate date for expecting mothers to prepare for the arrival of their baby.

### How it Works
The calculator uses the following steps to estimate the due date:

1. **Get Ovulation Date**: The script prompts the user to enter the date of their last period and their average cycle length. It then calculates theulation date by adding 14 days to the last period date and adjusting it based on the cycle length.

2. **Calculate Due Date**: The script adds 280 days (approximately 40 weeks) to the ovulation date to calculate the estimated due date.

Please note that this calculation assumes a 28-day cycle as the default. If the user's average cycle length differs from 28 days, the ovulation date is adjusted accordingly.
