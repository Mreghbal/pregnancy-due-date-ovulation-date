# pregnancy-due-date-ovulation-date
Here's a complete Python code for calculating the pregnancy due date based on the ovulation date and other parameters
This code prompts the user to enter the date of their last period and their average cycle length in days. It then calculates the ovulation date by adding 14 days to the last period date and adjusting it based on the cycle length. Finally, it calculates the estimated due date by adding 280 days to the ovulation date and prints it.

Please note that this code provides an estimated due date based on the assumption of a 28-day cycle. If your average cycle length differs from 28 days, the code will adjust the ovulation date accordingly. However, it's important to consult with a healthcare professional for an accurate assessment of your due date.
